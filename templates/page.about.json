Dogs are my favorite people.<\/p><p>I grew up in the woods in a house with 52 stairs, a German Shepherd named Big Dog and hippies for parents. We actually did have a mile walk up a dirt road to the bus stop.<\/p><p>I’ve learned over a life thus far lived that I do not enjoy being unconsciously whipped around by my own emotions or my own biology. This has led me to an unwavering desire to understand the evolutionary mechanisms and neurochemistry that drive us as humans.<\/p><p>I believe CHOICE is the magic we have as humans. We cannot often choose our circumstances but we can always choose our responses to our circumstances.<\/p><p>I’m clear. The fact that we exist is incredibly improbable. Yet here we are, the sentient owners of bodies built for survival and brains that refuse to accept that's all we are.
